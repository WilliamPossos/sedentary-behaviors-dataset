# New Dataset for sedentary behaviors recognition
For buil the dataset, we made an Android App

We present and made public a dataset for sedentary behaviors classification that includes data from 30 subjects, 
who performed 23 sedentary behaviors while wearing a commercial wearable on the wrist, a smartphone on hip 
and other in the bag. Also, 6 Bluetooth low energy beacons were used to obtain the symbolic indoor location from 
people while performing each sedentary behavior
