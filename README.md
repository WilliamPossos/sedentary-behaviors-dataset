# New Dataset for Sedentary Behaviors Recognition

For buil the dataset, we made an Android Application that integrate Microsoft Band and Estimote beacons. Those devices provide physiological and contextual data used to imprive traditional sedentary behaviors classification. 

We present and made public a dataset for sedentary behaviors classification that includes data from 30 subjects, who performed 23 sedentary behaviors while wearing a commercial wearable on the wrist, a smartphone on hip and other in the bag. Also, 6 Bluetooth low energy beacons were used to obtain the symbolic indoor location from people while performing each sedentary behavior
